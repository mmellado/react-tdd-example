Example of how to build a react component using TDD

You can run the code like this:

### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```
or
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the tests

```bash
npm run test
```

Each commit on this repository is a new step in the workflow to build a `ColorGallery` component using TDD. 
The very first step is the setup for running tests, followed by each step of adding new tests and code to make the tests pass, until the component is fully working.
